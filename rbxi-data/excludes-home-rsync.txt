## NOTE: rsync exclude paths start in the directory of the backup
## in this case, /home, for example, if you wanted to exclude
## /home/fred/.thumbnails you would NOT use:
## - /home/fred/.thumbnails
## but would instead exclude starting from the path that is being
## backed up, so the exclude would look like this:
## - /fred/.thumbnails
## or if you want to make it apply to all users:
## - /*/.thumbnails
## * means anything in the directory, in this case, anything in /home/.../
## /*/ means any directory in the container directory
## means anything at all, including /

### cache ###
- **/.mozilla/**/Cache/

### sockets ###
+ **/*.sock/
- **/*.sock
+ **/socket/
- **/socket

### trash ###
- **/.Trash-*
- **/lost+found

### User Data ###
## sample:
#- /*/.thumbnails
## or to exclude ALL .thumbnails directories found in /home:
#- **/.thumbnails
## this will NOT work as you expect:
#- /home/username/.thumbnails
## because it would be excluding: /home/home/username/.thumbnails, which doesn't exist.
## but this would:
#- /username/.thumbnails

## if you wanted to include the .thumbnails directory but NOT its content, do this:
## This only works for rsync, not rdiff-backup
#- /*/.thumbnails/
