rbxi is one of the family of smxi scripts. This one however runs on any unixlike system that supports bash, rsync, or rdiff-backup.

You can check out the [home page](http://techpatterns.com/forums/post-2607.html#2607) for more information, or download the [bz2 file directly](http://smxi.org/rb).

Check out [smxi.org](http://smxi.org) for more complete [rbxi installation options](http://smxi.org/site/install.htm#rbxi).

Most of the setup information is contained in the script readme file:
rbxi/rbxi-data/rbxi-values

and in the readme file:
rbxi/rbxi-data/readme-rbxi.htm
which is also available [online at smxi.org](http://smxi.org/docs/rbxi-main.htm)

And that's about all I'll post here, see also the script options, rbxi -h
for option information, but make sure to read the setup information.

This script does NOT work without manual user configuration of the rbxi-values file, which has a lot of comments explaining how to do it, along with the readme-rbxi.htm file.
